## Pattern Recognition
### Objective: 
To learn the fundamental theory and techniques of pattern recognition, and
to apply them to resolve problems in real-world applications.

### Content 
This course addresses the fundamental theory and techniques of pattern and 
features classification in numerical data. Pattern recognition methods can be 
useful in diverse real-world applications such as medical data processing, 
data mining, information retrieval, computer vision, handwriting and speech 
recognition, and more. The course topics include Bayesian decision theory, 
statistical classification, maximum likelihood estimation, nonparametric 
techniques, stochastic methods, and unsupervised learning.
