### Some definations
* **Neural Network**  
* **Weights**  
* **Bias**   
* **Activation function** 

* **Network parameters** 
Weights and biases are network parameters Œ∏.  

* **Feedforward neural network** 
A feedforward neural network is an artificial neural network wherein connections between the nodes do not form a cycle. As such, it is different from its descendant: recurrent neural networks.
The feedforward neural network was the first and simplest type of artificial neural network devised. In this network, the information moves in only one direction, forward, from the input nodes, through the hidden nodes (if any) and to the output nodes. There are no cycles or loops in the network.

* **Softmax Layer**
The [softmax function](https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/softmax-layer)  is a function that turns a vector of K real values into a vector of K real values that sum to 1.

* **Gradient Descent**
[Gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm for finding a local minimum of a differentiable function. 

* **Backpropagation**
In machine learning, [backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation) is a widely used algorithm in training feedforward neural networks for supervised learning.  
It is also an efficient way to compute ùúïùêø /ùúïùë§.

### Three Steps for Deep Learning   
* **1. Define a set of function**  
* **2. Estimate goodness of function**  
* **3. Pick the best function**
