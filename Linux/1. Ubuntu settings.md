### Jupyter
Project [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install.html) exists to develop open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages.   

If you use pip, you can install it with:
```bash
pip install jupyterlab
```

### Python
On Debian, Ubuntu, and other apt based systems, try to get the dependencies for the [Python](https://devguide.python.org/setup/) youâ€™re working on by using the apt command.

First, make sure you have enabled the source packages in the sources list. You can do this by adding the location of the source packages, including URL, distribution name and component name, to /etc/apt/sources.list. Take Ubuntu Bionic for example:

deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ bionic main
For other distributions, like Debian, change the URL and names to correspond with the specific distribution.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```
Now you can install the build dependencies via apt:

```bash
sudo apt-get build-dep python3.6
```
If that package is not available for your system, try reducing the minor version until you find a package that is available.

### Virtual Environment
Install
```bash
pip install virtualenv  
```

Run Virtual Environment  
env is the name of the new environment.
```bash
virtualenv env  
```

Enter Virtual Environment  
venv is your path of Virtual Environment.
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Close Virtual Environment  
```bash
deactivate
```

More info about [virtualenv](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/) 


### Zsh
Update the packages
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt upgrade
```

Install prerequisite packages (ZSH, powerline & powerline fonts)
```bash
sudo apt install zsh
sudo apt-get install powerline fonts-powerline
```

### MacOs
Make Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Look Like macOS  
Create 2 folders in Home directory, `.themes` and `.icons`, which accordingly contains some plugins downloaded from [ghome](https://www.gnome-look.org/s/Gnome/browse/)  

1.Download and install [MAC gtk theme](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1275087/) in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS ( We are using macOS Mojave theme): You need to extract the downloaded theme file and you need to copy it and move the folder inside to the ~/.themes folder in your Home directory.

2.Download and install [OS Catalina icon](https://www.gnome-look.org/s/Gnome/p/1309810) set in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
You should enable the universe repository in your Ubuntu.

3.Download and install [Dash To Dock Gnome](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/307/dash-to-dock/) extension, which is a dock for the Gnome Shell. This extension moves the dash out of the overview transforming it in a dock for an easier launching of applications and a faster switching between windows and desktops. Side and bottom placement options are available.

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository universe
```

Now, run the following command to install the Gnome Tweak tool on Ubuntu 20.04:

```bash
sudo apt install gnome-tweak-tool
```

You can start the Gnome Tweak Tool via command line with the following command:

```bash
gnome-tweaks
```
