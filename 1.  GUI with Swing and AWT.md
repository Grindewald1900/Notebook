## Start GUI with Swing and AWT

### Introduction
`JFC` Java programmers use the Java Foundation Classes, which include AWT and Swing to create GUI.  
`AWT` Abstract Windowing Toolkit, used for drawing graphics and creating graphical user interfaces.  
`Swing` is a library of classes that provide an improved alternative for creating GUI applications and applets, which is based on AWT to get the same performance under different platforms.

### Hierarchy of classes 
`Jframe` is the basic component of the Swing GUI framework
`Jpanel` is a container eligible to contain some other component, such as JLabel and JTextField.  

**`Jframe` extends `Frame` extends `Window` extends `Container` extends `Component` extends `Object`**
