## Android

### Language
[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) is better for beginner, while Java is still doing great.
For the languages, you can develop android apps either by using Kotlin or Java. Although, you can use both Kotlin and Java to develop native android apps,Google announced in 2019 to make Kotlin the preferred way of developing android applications. If you were to start learning android development today, Kotlin should be your language of choice.

### Fundamentals
**1. Install Android Studio**

**2. Kotlin Basics**  
* Learn the [basics](https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/absolute-beginners-guide-kotlin) of Kotlin  
* Kotlin [Docs](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/basic-syntax.html)   and Official Kotlin Tutorials  
* [Data Structures](https://www.studytonight.com/data-structures/introduction-to-data-structures) and Algorithms. Also check [this](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/index.htm).   
* Kotlin [DataStructures](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/collections-overview.html)     
* [Algorithms](https://github.com/bmaslakov/kotlin-algorithm-club) and DataStructures in Kotlin 


**3. OOP**  

**4. Data Structure and Algorithms**  

**5. Gradle**  
To prepare your software project for growth, you can organize a [Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/what_is_gradle.html) project into multiple subprojects to modularize the software you are building.   
**Five things you need to know about Gradle**
* 1. Gradle is a general-purpose build tool  
Gradle allows you to build any software, because it makes few assumptions about what you’re trying to build or how it should be done. The most notable restriction is that dependency management currently only supports Maven- and Ivy-compatible repositories and the filesystem.

This doesn’t mean you have to do a lot of work to create a build. Gradle makes it easy to build common types of project — say Java libraries — by adding a layer of conventions and prebuilt functionality through plugins. You can even create and publish custom plugins to encapsulate your own conventions and build functionality.

2. The core model is based on tasks
* 2. The core model is based on tasks
* 3. Gradle has several fixed build phases





### Version Control(Repo hosting)
